# Search for information on the web

In this Project we want to implement a search engine that contains an inverted index (posting list) and a field to enter a query that consists of "AND" and "OR".

This Project has gone through 3 stages:
    1- Preparation of the Corpus.
    2- Creation index inverted:
        at. Tokenization.
        b. Normalization (Convert strings to lowercase).
        c. Eliminate the Stopwords.
        d. Reverse index creation.
    3- Creation Bi-Gram index.
