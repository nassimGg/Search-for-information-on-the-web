# Search for information on the web

In this Project we want to implement a search engine that contains an inverted index (posting list) and a field to enter a query that consists of "AND" and "OR".

This Project has gone through 3 stages:
<ol>
<li> Preparation of the Corpus.</li>
<li> Creation index inverted:
    <ul>
        <li> Tokenization.</li>
        <li> Normalization (Convert strings to lowercase).</li>
        <li> Eliminate the Stopwords.</li>
        <li> Reverse index creation.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
    3- Creation Bi-Gram index.
</ol>
